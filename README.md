Chrome fullscreen urlbox
========================
It's a real shame that Chrome doesn't give access to its Omnibox while in full screen mode. This extension provides the user with an input box which can accept both search queries as well as URLs. Basically, it provides you with an omnibox of its own.

While in fullscreen mode (it also works in normal mode), press the extension's shortcut key to bring the Omnibox to display, then:

For searching, just enter the query and hit enter and you'll be taken to the google results page.

For going to a site/web page, just prefix the URL with a ~ sign to indicate its a URL and not a search query.

[Please note, any input without ~ sign wil be considered as a search query.]

Installing extension
====================
1. Download and save the .crx file in your computer.
2. Click the wrench icon on the browser toolbar.
3. Select Tools > Extensions.
4. Locate the extension file on your computer and drag the file onto the Extensions page.
5. Review the list of permissions in the dialog that appears. If you would like to proceed, click Install.
6. Set a keyboard shortcut for accessing this extension in full screen.

Setting shortcut key [Important]
================================
1. Click 'Configure Commands' link in the Extensions page.
2. There could be a number of names listed depending on the extensions you have installed.
3. Locate the one named 'Full screen URL box'.
4. Right next to it, there should be a text box. (If you've already set a shortcut it would be displayed, otherwise it would show 'Not set')
5. Click that textbox and press the key combination of your choice.
6. That's it. If it shows the key combination (like Ctrl+Q) you're ready to use the extension. Have fun!

P.S.: You can set any shortcut key of your choice. I personally prefer Ctrl+Q as its easy to reach.
